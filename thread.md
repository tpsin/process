### Thread

A thread is a basic unit of CPU utilization; it comprises a thread ID, a program counter, a register set, and a stack. 
It shares with other threads belonging to the same process its code section, 
data section, and other operating-system resources, such as open files and signals.

A process is an executing program with a single thread of control.
