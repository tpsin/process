# Scheduling

-  **Burst Time** is  the time that is required to complete execution of particular *process*.
-  **Waiting time** is the time for which *process* is ready to run but not executed by the scheduler.
-  **Turnaround time** is the total time taken between the submission of a *process* for execution and the return of the complete output to the user.

## Scheduling Algorithm

### First Come First Serve (FCFS)

|   	|   Burst time 	|  Waiting time	|  Turnaround time	|
|--:	|--:	|--:	|---	|
|   P1	|   18	|  0 	|  18 	|
|   P2	|   5	|   18	|  23 	|
|   P3	|   7	|   23	|  30 	|
